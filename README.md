# Workshop: GraphQL with Hot Chocolate & .NET 6

## üéØ Goal of the Workshop

We would like to give you an insight into the development with GraphQL based on Hot Chocolate and .NET. We as a team have gained a lot of experience with GraphQL and are looking forward to share it with you.

At the end of this workshop, you should be able to decide on your own if GraphQL is the right technology for your projects and have the knowledge to use it.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Prerequisites

### **Knowhow prerequisite**

Basic experience in development with C# and ASP.NET (Core). Experience with REST APIs is an advantage.

### **Tech prerequisite**

- IDE: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) / Rider / Visual Studio
- SDK: [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
- A GraphQL Client like [Banana Cake Pop](https://chillicream.com/docs/bananacakepop) or [Altair GraphQL Client](https://altair.sirmuel.design/)

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What you'll be building

In this workshop, you'll learn by building a full-featured GraphQL Server with ASP.NET Core and Hot Chocolate from scratch. We'll start from File/New and build up a full-featured GraphQL server with custom middleware, filters, subscription and relay support.
